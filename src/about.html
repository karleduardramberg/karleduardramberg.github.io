	&bull; I've been enjoying and documenting unseasonably warm weather<br>
	&bull; I read <a href="https://theiceplant.cc/product/to-photograph-is-to-learn-how-to-die/"><i>To photograph is to learn how to die</i></a> by Tim Carpenter and loved it<br>
	&bull; I'm working on a vase in a ceramics course<br>
	&bull; I built a desk a few months ago and it's starting to warp now<br>
	&bull; I just started a small book club with a few photographer friends, our first book is <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i><br>
	&bull; I'm hopefully graduating (twice) in a few months
