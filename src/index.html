	I recommend  <a href="https://www.editionpatrickfrey.com/de/books/das-fluestern-der-dinge-thomas-krempke"><i>Das Flüstern der Dinge</i></a> by Thomas Krempke, it’s wonderful. At the very least it’s good motivation to work on my German.
	I graduated college last month, I turn 24 today.
	Last month I spent a week or so in northern Minnesota, hands down the best place on Earth. I tried to take pictures in a quarry and a mine but was turned away.
	Job applications are soul sucking.

	I got the “Outstanding Undergraduate Student in Art” award from my university that I didn’t know was a thing, so that’s kinda neat.
	View cameras are cool, for reasons I’ve never thought of before.
	I’m (very) slowly reading <i>Crime and Punishment</i>.
	I made a book of archival pictures about Russian Orthodoxy on Kodiak Island for my mother. At some point I'll upload pictures of it here.
	I’m working on a stupid dragonfly sculpture that is stupid and will go in the trash as soon as I get my grade for it.

	<a href="nine_by_six.html"><i>9 by 6 or 8 by 7</i></a> was selected for my university’s annual juried exhibition.
	I read <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>, it is very much the gateway drug to Russian lit.
	I’m currently waiting on eighteen rolls to be developed and shipped back to me. Eighteen is an enormous amount for me.

	I've been enjoying and documenting unseasonably warm weather.
	I read <a href="https://theiceplant.cc/product/to-photograph-is-to-learn-how-to-die/"><i>To photograph is to learn how to die</i></a> by Tim Carpenter and loved it.
	I'm working on a vase in a ceramics course.
	I built a desk a few months ago and it's starting to warp now.
	I just started a small book club with a few photographer friends.
	I'm graduating (twice) in a few months.

	Five pictures from <a href="nemo.html"><i>Nemo</i></a> are at the Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art in St. Joseph, Missouri until June 12th.
	My friend, Bryan Birks, said several kind words about me in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Us7soiQRK8g&t=805">video</a>.
	My BA thesis show was back in December at Truman State University (You can view a video walkthrough at <a href="https://youtu.be/8or_LN7rxnI">youtu.be/8or_LN7rxnI</a>).
	Last year, I wrote a <a href="http://vesseleditions.com/243428331774/roberts-adams-pine-valley">review</a> of <i>Pine Valley</i> by Robert Adams for Vessel Editions that I am still very pleased with.
