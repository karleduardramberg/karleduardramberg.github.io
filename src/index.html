	It's been too warm for this time of year, climate change sucks. 
	I was lucky enough to spend two weeks in Berlin, I'll probably work on a little book with the pictures I took soon.
	I've been shooting color and sending things off to a lab in New York. I suppose that's important because I am giving up a little bit of control (I used to develop everything myself) to gain time and energy to shoot more.
	Every winter, as usual, my dislike for social media grows. I think I love just updating this page every once in a while and people can choose when (or if) to check it.
	This website layout is new, it took me far too long. I waffle back and forth about pages and how much to add and how polished things need to be; very uninteresting things. I need to take more pictures.
	I've decided that when (not if) I get a cat, I will name them either Eug√®ne or Walker.
