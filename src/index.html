	The winter wind is refusing to leave, but the grass is green again.
	I've been reading W.G. Sebald's <i>The Rings of Saturn</i>.
	The other day I met a man viewing the sunset through a cell phone strapped to his childhood telescope.
	He gave me three copies of his business card, filled with bible verses and descriptions of astronomical events.
	I've taken at least four pictures of birdhouses in the past month.
