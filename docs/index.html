	It's been cold. Very cold. I saw a sun dog the other morning. 
	Last night I read the Wikipedia article for Dark-eyed juncos.
	I read The Waste Land and got confused.
	I have an array of workprints from <i>Point Nemo</i> on my wall. For once it feels coherent.
	I turned my photography bookmarks folder into a <a target="_blank" href="https://photoland.directory">webpage</a>.
	Recent subjects from pictures include, but are not limited to: a burned-out house, a large dog, running shoes tied together and thrown over a powerline, an outhouse painted with sunflowers, pasta on the stove, lots of ice and snow.
