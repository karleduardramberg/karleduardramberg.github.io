	It's been cold. Very cold. I saw a sun dog the other morning. 
	Last night I read the Wikipedia article for Dark-eyed juncos.
	I read The Waste Land and am confused.
	I have an array of workprints from <i>Point Nemo</i> on my wall. For once it feels coherent.
	I turned my photography bookmarks folder into a <a target="_blank" href="https://photoland.directory">webpage</a>.
	Recent subjects from pictures include, but are not limited to: a burned-out house, a large dog, running shoes tied together and thrown over a powerline, an outhouse painted with sunflowers, pasta on the stove, lots of ice and snow.

	It's been too warm for this time of year, climate change sucks. 
	I was lucky to spend two weeks in Berlin in August. I'll try to work on a little book with the pictures I took soon.
	I've been shooting lots of color and sending things off to a lab in New York.
	Every winter, as usual, my dislike for social media grows. I think I love just updating this page and people can choose when (or if) to check it.
	This website layout is new, it took me far too long. I waffle back and forth about pages and how much to add and how polished things need to be; very uninteresting things. I need to take more pictures.
	I've decided that when (not if) I get a cat, I will name them either Eugène or Walker.

	I recommend <a href="https://www.editionpatrickfrey.com/de/books/das-fluestern-der-dinge-thomas-krempke" target="_blank"><i>Das Flüstern der Dinge</i></a> by Thomas Krempke, it’s wonderful. At the very least it’s good motivation to work on my German.
	I graduated college last month, I turn 24 today.
	Last month I spent a week or so in northern Minnesota, hands down the best place on Earth. I tried to take pictures in a quarry and a mine but was turned away.
	Job applications are soul sucking.

	I got the “Outstanding Undergraduate Student in Art” award from my university that I didn’t know was a thing, so that’s kinda neat.
	View cameras are cool, for reasons I’ve never thought of before.
	I’m (very) slowly reading <i>Crime and Punishment</i>.
	I made a book of archival pictures about Russian Orthodoxy on Kodiak Island for my mother. At some point I'll upload pictures of it here.
	I’m working on a stupid dragonfly sculpture that is stupid and will go in the trash as soon as I get my grade for it.

	<a href="nine_by_six.html"><i>9 by 6 or 8 by 7</i></a> was selected for my university’s annual juried exhibition.
	I read <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>, it is very much the gateway drug to Russian lit.
	I’m currently waiting on eighteen rolls to be developed and shipped back to me. Eighteen is an enormous amount for me.

	<span class="gray">February 23, 2023 &mdash;</span>
	I've been enjoying and documenting unseasonably warm weather.
	I read <a href="https://theiceplant.cc/product/to-photograph-is-to-learn-how-to-die/" target="_blank"><i>To photograph is to learn how to die</i></a> by Tim Carpenter and loved it.
	I'm working on a vase in a ceramics course.
	I built a desk a few months ago and it's starting to warp now.
	I just started a small book club with a few photographer friends.
	I'm graduating (twice) in a few months.

	Five pictures from <a href="nemo.html"><i>Nemo</i></a> are at the Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art in St. Joseph, Missouri until June 12th.
	My friend, Bryan Birks, said several kind words about me in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Us7soiQRK8g&t=805" target="_blank">video</a>.
	My BA thesis show was back in December at Truman State University (You can view a video walkthrough at <a href="https://youtu.be/8or_LN7rxnI" target="_blank">youtu.be/8or_LN7rxnI</a>).
	Last year, I wrote a <a href="http://vesseleditions.com/243428331774/roberts-adams-pine-valley" target="_blank">review</a> of <i>Pine Valley</i> by Robert Adams for Vessel Editions that I am still very pleased with.
